# Design of Java Code Metrics Calculator (Group ::X::)

## Context

### Goal

Objective of the Java Code Metrics Calculator (JCMC) is to be able to determine the maintainability of Java software. It will do so by providing various code metrics, such as lines of code. 

### Key requirements

JCMC will be run from the commandline, taking a directory (containing Java source code) as its input, and will provide a text file as output, containing metrics.

JCMC will be robust, and it will not fail when encountering non-compiling Java files.

### Risks

JCMC is developed as part of the DHL Training Module II. It must therefore achieve at least two of these four objectives by Day 5 of the training:

1. All functional requirements have been fulfilled
2. The design is documented
3. ISO 25010 maintainability is at least 4 stars
4. Test coverage is at least 80%

The risk of this objective not being achieved is mitigated by instructors being present to assist, as well as result inspections and discussions on Day 2 and 4 of the course.

### Technology

The use of Java as the programming language is mandated by the DHL Training Module II, and cannot be deviated from.
